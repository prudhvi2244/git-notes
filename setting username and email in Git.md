# Setting your username in Git

## Git uses a username to associate commits with an identity. The Git username is not the same as your GitHub username.

### You can change the name that is associated with your Git commits using the git config command. The new name you set will be visible in any future commits you push to GitHub from the command line.

### Changing the name associated with your Git commits using git config will only affect future commits and will not change the name used for past commits.

**Setting your Git username for every repository on your computer**
